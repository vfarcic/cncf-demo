# Define And Deploy The App To Dev With CDK For Kubernetes (cdk8s)

**Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for Kubernetes (cdk8s)** is an open source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications using familiar programming languages. 

cdk8s reduces cognitive load for developers in three ways:
* Developers can use the programming languages that they're already familiar with - and they can do all of the code things (conditionals, loops, inheritance, completion, testing, etc)
* Developers interact with cdk8s' simplified API instead of the Kubernetes API - therefore they don't have to understand as much about Kubernetes
* cdk8s can incorporate organization-wide guardrails and best practices so developers don't have to worry about it

cdk8s helps organizations in three ways:
* cdk8s code synthesises into plain Kubernetes yaml manifests that can be applied to any distribution of Kubernetes
* With cdk8s, you can define best practices and organization-wide defaults and distribute them as cdk8s libraries
* Orgs can additionally incorporate policy enforcement in the `synth` step (when the cdk8s code gets reconciled into yaml)

The bottom line here is that organizations can give freedom to developers to write their own Kubernetes configuration in a pleasant and efficient way while also providing guardrails and best practices.


## Setup

* [Install the `cdk8s` CLI](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/installation)
* We'll define the manifests in Go (even though other languages are supported) so please install and configure [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

```bash
chmod +x manuscript/define-deploy-dev/cdk8s.sh

./manuscript/define-deploy-dev/cdk8s.sh
```

## Do

```bash
cd cdk8s

cat main.go

cat app.go

cdk8s synth --output ../yaml/dev --validate 

cd ..

cat yaml/dev/cncf-demo.k8s.yaml

kubectl --namespace dev apply --filename yaml/dev

echo "http://cncf-demo-dev.$DOMAIN"

# Open it in a browser
```

* If you chose `kbld` to build images, you'll need to run the `synth` command to convert the chart into "pure" Kubernetes YAML manifests. Then with one command you can use `kbld` to build the images, push them to a registry, and modify the manifests with image SHAs. Next use `kubectl` to apply the manifests generated by `kbld`.
