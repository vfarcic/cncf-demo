# Define And Deploy The App To Dev With Helm

At its core, a Helm chart is simply a directory that has three required items:

* **templates directory** - a directory of templated Kubernetes resources. Templates are Golang-based.

* **values.yaml file** - contains values for the templated resources

* **chart.yaml file** - contains metadata about the chart

Helm *templates* are the key to defining Kubernetes resources in a dynamic, reusable way. With Helm templates, you can use programming logic to help define your Kubernetes resources. You can also create reusable functions using the [Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) framework. These functions are called *partials*. 

Once you define all of your Kubernetes resources and specify their values in a Helm chart, you use the Helm CLI to install that chart to your Kubernetes cluster. This creates a running instance of your application called a Helm *release*.  


## Setup

* [Install the `helm` CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install)

```bash
chmod +x manuscript/define-deploy-dev/helm.sh

./manuscript/define-deploy-dev/helm.sh
```

## Do

```bash
ls -1 helm/app/templates

cat helm/app/templates/deployment.yaml

cat helm/app/templates/service.yaml

cat helm/app/templates/ingress.yaml

cat helm/app/values.yaml

yq --inplace ".image.tag = \"$TAG\"" helm/app/values.yaml

cat helm/app/values.yaml

helm upgrade --install cncf-demo helm/app --namespace dev --wait

echo "http://cncf-demo-dev.$DOMAIN"

# Open it in a browser
```

* If you chose `kbld` to build images, you'll need to run `helm template` command to convert the chart into "pure" Kubernetes YAML manifests. Then you can use `kbld` to build the images, modify the manifests with image SHAs, and use `kubectl` to apply the manifests generated by `kbld`.
